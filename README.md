# Notifications

## Intro

My attempt at cloning [the Mac OS X Notification Center](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=notification+center&tbm=isch) using the [Python GTK3](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [dbus bindings](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-python/doc/tutorial.html). (It was a feature I missed since migrating to Ubuntu.)

So far I'm half way through an extremely rough proof of concept. When the basics work I'll tidy up the code and interface. **So far this does not work and the code is crap, move along!**
